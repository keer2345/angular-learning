**Chapter 01 Writing Your First Angular Web Application**

# Simple Reddit Clone

You can think of this app as the beginnings of a site like [Reddit](http://reddit.com/) or [Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com/).

In this simple app we’re going to cover most of the essentials of Angular including:
- Building custom components
- Accepting user input from forms
- Rendering lists of objects into views
- Intercepting user clicks and acting on them
- Deploying our app to a server

# Getting started
## Install
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng --version
```

## Create new project
```
ng new angular-hello-world
cd angular-hello-world
tree -F -L 1
```

# Running the application
```
cd angular-hello-world
ng serve
ng serve --port 9001
```

## Making a Component
```
ng generate component hello-world
```

## Adding Data to the Component
```
ng g c user-item
```

## Working With Arrays
```
ng g c user-list
```

`*ngFor` :
```
<li *ngFor="let name of names">Hello {{ name }}</li>
```

## Accepting Inputs
```
import { Component, OnInit, Input } from "@angular/core";

export class UserItemComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() name: string;

  // ...

}
```
## Passing an Input value
```html
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let name of names">
    <app-user-item [name]="name"></app-user-item>
  </li>
</ul>
```

## Bootstrapping Crash Course
`app.module.ts`:

- _declarations_
- _imports_
- _provides_
- _bootstrap_

# Expanding our Application

```
ng new angular-reddit
```

For this project we’re going to be using [Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) to help with the styling.
```
npm install -g gulp
npm install semantic-ui --save
cd semantic/
gulp build
```

# Deployment
Building Our App for Production
```
ng build --prod
```

Uploading to a Server
```
npm install -g now
```
```
cd dist/angular-reddit
now
```
