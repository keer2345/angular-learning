# Why choose Angular?
- Inspired by web standards, enhanced by modern capabilities
- Development tooling included, customizations available
- Powerful ecosystem with a large community
- Sponsored by Google, open source community driven

# What you’ll learn
- The key takeaways in this book include the following:
- How Angular works 
- How to build applications 
- Learn about the ecosystem 
- Get practical insights from my experiences

The following are not core topics covered in this book:
- How to write libraries
- Every available API and features 
- How to design your app and UX principles 

# The journey from AngularJS to Angular

# Angular: a platform, not a framework
Angular comes with a leaner core library and makes additional features available as separate packages that can be used as needed. It also has many tools that push it beyond a simple framework, including the following:
- Dedicated CLI for application development, testing, and deployment
- Offline rendering capabilities on many back-end server platforms
- Desktop-, mobile-, and browser-based application execution environments
- Comprehensive UI component libraries, such as Material Design

## Angular CLI
You can install the CLI using npm. It does require that you have a recent version of NodeJS installed to run properly:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
The CLI has a number of features that aid in the development of Angular apps. Here are the primary features:
- Generates new project scaffolding
- Generates new application pieces 
- Manages the entire build toolchain
- Serves a localhost development server
- Incorporates code linting and formatting code
- Supports running unit and e2e tests 

## Server rendering and the compiler
Why does this matter? Let’s explore a few primary use cases:
- Server rendering for faster loading
- Performance in the browser 
- SEO
- Multiple platforms 

## Mobile and desktop capabilities
- Ionic (mobile) 
- NativeScript (mobile)
- React Native (mobile, desktop) 
- Windows Universal (desktop)
- Electron (desktop)
- Progressive Web Apps (mobile, desktop) 

## UI libraries
- [Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material2)
- [Covalent](https://teradata.github.io/covalent) 
- [Clarity](https://vmware.github.io/clarity)
- [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io)
- [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/) 
- [PrimeNG](www.primefaces.org/primeng/)
- [Wijmo](http://wijmo.com/angular2/) 
- [Ionic](http://ionic.io) 
- [Fuel-UI](http://fuelinteractive.github.io/fuel-ui/)


# Component architecture
## Components’ key characteristics
- **Encapsulation** — Keeping component logic in a single place
- **Isolation** — Keeping component internals hidden from external actors
- **Reusability** — Allowing component reuse with minimal effort
- **Evented** — Emitting events during the lifecycle of the component
- **Customizable** — Making it possible to style and extend the component
- **Declarative** — Using a component with simple declarative markup

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the primary standards body for the web, is developing an official Web Component specification. Several standards are required in order to implement the full vision of web components:
- Custom elements (encapsulation, declarative, reusability, evented)
- Shadow DOM (isolation, encapsulation, customizable)
- Templates (encapsulation, isolation)
- JavaScript modules (encapsulation, isolation, reusability)

## Shadow DOM

## Templates

## JavaScript modules

# Modern JavaScript and Angular

- Classes
- Decorators
- Modules
- Template literals

## Observables

# TypeScript and Angular
Many developers wonder why they should bother learning and using TypeScript. Here are the primary reasons to use TypeScript, in my humble opinion:
- Adds clarity to your code
- Enables a smarter editor 
- Catches errors before you run code 
- Entirely optional 

# Summary
- Angular is a platform, with many key elements such as tooling, UI libraries, and testing built in or easily incorporated into your application projects.
- Applications are essentially combinations of components. These components build upon the core principles of encapsulation, isolation, and reusability, which should have events, be customizable, and be declarative.
- ES6 and TypeScript provide a lot of the underpinnings for Angular’s architecture and syntax, making it a powerful framework without having to build a lot of custom language capabilities.
