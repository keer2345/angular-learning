**Chapter 02 Building your first Angular App**

This chapter covers
- Angular components and how they form a basis for your app
- Defining a number of types of components, using decorators
- Learning how services can be used to share data across your app
- Setting up routing to display different pages

In this chapter, we’ll build this app piece by piece. We’ll focus on getting through the example application with enough detail to understand the various pieces and complexity in this chapter:
- Bootstrapping the app
- Creating components
- Creating services and using HttpClient
- Using pips and directives in templates
- Setting up routing
